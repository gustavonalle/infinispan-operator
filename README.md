# infinispan-operator
This is an openshift operator to run and rule Infinispan.

It has been developed following the tutorial [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md), so it's ok to follow that guide at the moment if you want to do experiments  on this code.

My developement envronment is:

vscode
go (GOPATH=$HOME/go)
operator-sdk (master)
oc cluster up (okd 3.11)

I would like to keep DONE and TODO list in [issues](https://github.com/rigazilla/infinispan-operator/issues), please post your wishes there.
